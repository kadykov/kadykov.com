      But wait!
      It only means
      that for now
      there is not much
      content available on this website.

      By the way,
      I'm Aleksandr,
      and this is my personal project
      where I'm learning web technologies
      and sharing my photography and thoughts.
      Currently,
      I'm exploring new opportunities
      as a Research Engineer.
      If you're interested
      in learning more
      about my background and experience,
