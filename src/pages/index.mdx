        But wait!
        It only means
        that for now
        there is not much
        content available on this website.

        By the way,
        I'm Aleksandr,
        and this is my personal project
        where I'm learning web technologies
        and sharing my photography and thoughts.
        Currently,
        I'm exploring new opportunities
        as a Research Engineer.
        If you're interested
        in learning more
        about my background and experience,
        you can check my CV
        in [web](cv)
        or [PDF](https://github.kadykov.com/typstCV/kadykov-cv-en.pdf)
