    ## Introduction

    This is the personal website of Aleksandr Kadykov.
    I am based in the European Union and am committed to protecting your privacy.
    This website is a static site built with
    [AstroJS](https://astro.build/),
    designed to be as privacy-respecting as possible.

    As the data controller for this website,
    you can contact me at
    [web@kadykov.com](mailto:web@kadykov.com).

    ## Website hosting and data collection

    This website is hosted by
    [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
    Netlify may collect some data for the purpose of providing their service.
    You can read more in the
    [Netlify Privacy Policy](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/).

    ### Contact form

    The contact form on this website is powered by
    [Netlify Forms](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/).
    When you submit the form,
    the data you provide
    (such as your name and email address)
    is sent to me and stored by Netlify to manage submissions.

    please refer to the section on
    [Netlify Forms and GDPR](https://www.netlify.com/gdpr-ccpa/).

    ## Website analytics

    I use [Umami](https://umami.is/) for website analytics.
    Umami is a privacy-friendly analytics tool
    that does not use cookies and does not collect any personally identifiable information.
    All data is anonymized and aggregated.

    To be fully transparent,
    the analytics dashboard for this website is publicly available.
    You are welcome to view the same data I see
    at [cloud.umami.is](https://cloud.umami.is/share/P2jpjw4GRjETgEhO/www.kadykov.com).
    This allows you to verify what data is collected
    and see for yourself that no personal information is tracked.

    ## Photography and personal data

    One of my hobbies is photography,
    and this website features photo galleries.
    Some of these photographs include people.
    The purpose of publishing these photos is purely artistic and documentary.

    All photos,
    unless otherwise specified,
    are licensed under CC BY 4.0.
    However, the rights of the individuals depicted in the photographs are respected.
    If you are in a photo and wish for it to be removed or anonymized,
    you have the right to request this.

    Please contact me via
    the [contact form](/contact)
    or by email at [web@kadykov.com](mailto:web@kadykov.com)
    with your request, and I will promptly address it.

    ## Your rights under GDPR

    As a user, you have several rights under
    the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/), including:
    - The right to access your personal data.
    - The right to have your personal data corrected.
    - The right to have your personal data erased.
    - The right to object to the processing of your personal data.

    Since this website collects very limited personal data
    (only through the contact form),
    you can exercise these rights by contacting me at [web@kadykov.com](mailto:web@kadykov.com).
