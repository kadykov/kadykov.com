<BaseLayout frontmatter={frontmatter}>

    <h1 style="font-size: 5.5rem; font-weight: 100; letter-spacing: 1rem;">
      404
    </h1>
    <p>You know what it means...</p>
  </Hero>
  <article>
    <h2>Not Found</h2>
    <p>
      A quick note on what this actually means: HTTP status codes in the 400s
      indicate a client-side problem (for example a mistyped address, broken
      link, or a page that was removed). Server errors use the 500 range, so if
      something was wrong on my end, you'd see a 500-series error instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      So a 404 is a "Not Found" from the client's point of view — which, in the
      spirit of gentle teasing, means it's (probably) your fault you're seeing
      this page and not mine. If you think otherwise, please <a href="/contact"
        >contact me</a
      > and I'll take a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, you can try going back to the <a href="/">home page</a>
      or using the site navigation to find what you're looking for.
    </p>
