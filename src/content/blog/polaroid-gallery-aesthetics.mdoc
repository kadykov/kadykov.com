## Beyond Layout: The Viewing Experience

In a [previous post](/blog/designing-a-photo-gallery-layout),
I explored different photo gallery layouts and why I chose a cell-span grid
that gives landscape and portrait photos equal visual weight.
But layout is only part of the story.

This post documents the aesthetic refinements layered on top of that grid:
Polaroid-style borders that anchor color perception,
a double-border structure that handles bright highlights,
subtle rotation that breaks mechanical alignment,
and a neutral gray background that provides consistent color context.

You can see this implementation in action at [kadykov.com/photos](/photos),
and explore the [source code](https://github.com/kadykov/kadykov.com) for implementation details.

## Polaroid-Style Framing

The cell-span layout handles orientation equality,
but additional aesthetic refinements enhance the presentation
while providing practical benefits.

### Why Off-White Matters More Than You'd Think

Look closely at the Polaroid borders and you might notice something subtle: they're not pure white.
Instead, they're set to a light off-white — around 90–95% white.
This choice serves multiple perceptual purposes.

First, the border acts as a **white balance reference point**.
When viewing photos under non-ideal lighting —
warm incandescent bulbs, cool fluorescent lights, or miscalibrated displays —
both the photo and border shift color together.
The human visual system uses the "white" border as an anchor and recalibrates perception accordingly.
This helps photo colors appear more accurate despite environmental color casts.

Second, the off-white creates a **perceptual contrast boost**.
Against the deliberately darker, desaturated page background,
the viewer's eye perceives the border as "pure white" in context.
This means any 100% white elements in the photo itself —
clouds, snow, highlights — appear even brighter by comparison.
The effect increases perceived dynamic range:
whites feel more brilliant and blacks appear deeper.

Finally, because borders are CSS rather than baked into image files,
they compress better and introduce no artifacts around frame edges.

### The Double Border Structure

The border actually has two layers:

- **Thick outer border** — off-white, provides the perceptual "paper white" reference
- **Thin inner border** — light gray, separates bright photo areas from the outer frame

Without the inner border, bright photo regions —
clouds, snow, light skies — visually blend into the white frame.
This breaks our contrast illusion: the viewer can see that the border isn't pure white.
Even when both surfaces are technically "white",
but at different color temperatures, the transition looks unpleasant.
The thin gray separator solves both problems by making the boundary clear.

<!-- TODO: Add border comparison screenshot showing single vs double border -->

When the photo has darker edges, the inner border's impact is minimal —
just a few pixels of light gray very close to the off-white outer border.
It doesn't disrupt the overall white-frame aesthetic or wash out deep blacks.
But it prevents the visual confusion where image and mount merge into one.

## Neutral Gray Environment

One final detail completes the viewing environment:
the page uses a **neutral gray background** with zero chroma.
This prevents any hue bias from affecting color perception —
unlike warm beige or cool blue-grays, true neutral gray doesn't push reds, greens, or blues in any direction.
Combined with the off-white Polaroid borders,
this creates a consistent viewing context that works equally well in light and dark modes.
The result is closer to a color-neutral print viewing environment
than the stark white or deep black backgrounds common on photo sites.

## A Side Benefit: Aspect Ratio Nudging

Beyond aesthetics, the asymmetric Polaroid borders provide a modest practical benefit:
they help nudge photos closer to their target aspect ratios.

Real photographs rarely match target aspect ratios exactly.
A landscape shot might be 16:9 (much wider than our 3:2 target)
or 4:3 (falling between landscape and square).
For each photo, we decide whether to place the thicker border on the side or bottom.
For panorama-like landscapes (16:9 or wider),
placing it on the bottom makes the overall frame more "squarish" — closer to the 3:2 target.
For less extreme landscapes (4:3), adding the thicker border to the side stretches it wider toward 3:2.

<!-- TODO: Add borders.svg diagram showing aspect ratio nudging -->

This doesn't reduce the number of trapped or unused cells —
that's inherent to the cell-span approach —
but it does reduce wasted space *within* the cells that photos occupy.
The effect is modest, and borders shift the aspect ratio of all photos (even those already at target),
but since perfectly matched photos are in the minority,
the net effect is still an improvement in space utilization.

## Adding Visual Playfulness: Rotation

One more detail softens the mechanical feel: **slight random rotation**.
We rotate each photo by a small random angle drawn from a normal distribution.
The result: Polaroid cards that look scattered by hand rather than aligned by machine.

<!-- TODO: Add cell-span-tilted.svg diagram showing rotation effect -->

The rotation is subtle — just enough to break rigid alignment without creating chaos.
Combined with the inconsistent gap alignment inherent in the cell-span layout,
this produces a layout that feels organic and tactile,
more like prints pinned to a wall than tiles in a spreadsheet.

## Bringing It All Together

These aesthetic choices work together to create a viewing experience
that feels intentional and considered:

- **Off-white borders** anchor color perception and boost perceived dynamic range
- **Double-border structure** cleanly separates bright photo edges from frames
- **Neutral gray background** provides unbiased color context
- **Asymmetric borders** nudge photos toward target aspect ratios
- **Subtle rotation** breaks mechanical alignment for an organic feel

None of these refinements require JavaScript.
They're pure CSS enhancements that work on top of any grid layout,
though they complement the cell-span approach particularly well
because that layout already accepts some visual irregularity in exchange for equal presentation.

The result is a gallery that feels less like a digital interface
and more like a physical collection of photographs —
prints scattered on a desk or pinned to a wall,
each one presented fairly and viewed in optimal conditions.
