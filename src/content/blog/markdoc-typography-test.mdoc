# Heading 1 and usually it is short

## Heading 2 could be longer than the title, but still concise

### Heading 3 also works well for sub-sections. But it could be quite long if needed

#### Heading 4 is useful for deeper hierarchy. It also can be quite long, but should still be readable.

This is a sample paragraph meant to test the visual rendering of body text. It contains multiple sentences to observe line spacing, font legibility, and overall flow. Typography should guide the reader's eye comfortably across the screen, with good contrast, readable font size, and pleasant rhythm.

Here's a second paragraph to ensure spacing between paragraphs is visually clear and aesthetically pleasing. A good typographic system handles vertical rhythm with grace, making transitions from headings to body text natural and unobtrusive. Typography is as much about space as it is about letters.

## Testing Optimized Images with Markdoc

Now we can include images that will be automatically optimized!

And here's how it works with remote images:

This sentence includes **bold**, _italic_, and **_bold italic_** text. It also contains `inline code` to see how monospaced fonts appear inline.

> This is a blockquote designed to test how your system renders quoted text.  
> It should be indented, perhaps with a different font or color, to set it apart from regular body content.

## Unordered List

- This item describes a full idea or observation. The goal here is to simulate a bullet point that might be found in technical documentation, meeting notes, or a blog post outline. It contains more than one sentence, allowing for evaluation of text wrapping, line spacing, and padding within the list item.

- Another example of a longer list item. Imagine this is a design note or a comment during a code review. You might mention how a component behaves under certain conditions, discuss alternatives, and propose changes—all within a single bullet.

- Finally, a third item to test how multiple long items stack visually. This ensures that readers don't lose their place and that the layout remains clean and scannable, even when content in each item is substantial.

## Ordered List

1. First, consider how your typography handles numerals, spacing, and indentation for long-form list items like this one. The item includes enough content to mimic a paragraph, which should not break the visual alignment with the number itself. The goal is a tidy, readable experience.

2. Second, use this item to test how your font handles line breaks and whether multi-line content within a numbered list maintains correct vertical spacing. This is especially important in documentation or tutorials where instructions are long.

3. Lastly, this final item can include a note about accessibility: ensure the font choice, color contrast, and spacing are friendly for readers with various visual needs. Good typography is inclusive.
