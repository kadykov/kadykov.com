# Project Progress: Personal Website (kadykov.com)

This document tracks the development progress, current status, and known issues for the kadykov.com website.

## 1. Current Overall Status
-   **Date**: 2025-06-04
-   **Phase**: Blog Refinement - URL Structure, Listing Page Styling, and Image Handling.
-   **Summary**: Completed a major overhaul of the blog's URL structure, styled the blog listing and tag pages with DaisyUI cards, and refined image rendering in these cards for consistency and CLS prevention. Semantic typography applied to new blog page titles.

## 2. What Works (Post-Blog Phase I & Recent Refinements)
-   **Core Pages**: Home, About, CV (Markdown), Contact (Netlify Forms).
-   **Blog - Foundational Refinements (Complete)**:
    *   Content collections modernized (`src/content/blog/`).
    *   Individual post rendering uses modern Astro APIs (`src/layouts/MarkDownPostLayout.astro`).
    *   `hello-world.md` test post available.
-   **Blog - Typographic Refinement for Post Layout (Complete)**:
    *   `MarkDownPostLayout.astro` uses semantic text utility classes.
    *   `.prose-serif` styles Markdown content with semantic classes.
    *   Consistent typography on individual blog posts.
    *   Semantic text utilities defined in `src/styles/base.css`.
-   **Blog - URL Structure, Listing Pages, and Card Styling (Complete as of 2025-06-04)**:
    *   **URL Structure**: Posts now at `/blog/[slug]` (no `.md` extension). Dynamic route is `src/pages/blog/[...slug].astro`.
    *   **Listing Pages**:
        *   Main listing at `/blog/` (`src/pages/blog/index.astro`).
        *   Tag-specific listings at `/tags/[tag]/` (`src/pages/tags/[tag].astro`).
        *   Both pages display posts as a grid of DaisyUI cards.
        *   Page titles (`<h1>`) use `text-heading-1` semantic class.
    *   **`BlogPost.astro` Component**:
        *   Enhanced as a DaisyUI card displaying title, date, description, thumbnail, and tags.
        *   Uses semantic typography classes for its content.
        *   Integrates `OptimizedImage.astro` for thumbnails.
    *   **RSS Feed**: `src/pages/rss.xml.js` updated for new paths and collection.
    *   **Tag Pages**: `src/pages/tags/[tag].astro` updated for new paths, collection, and robust tag handling.
-   **Image Optimization & Rendering**:
    *   `OptimizedImage.astro` component:
        *   Integrated into `MarkDownPostLayout.astro` and `BlogPost.astro`.
        *   Handles remote image dimension inference for CLS prevention.
        *   `picture` tag does not impose `max-width`, allowing parent containers to control size.
        *   Correctly fills `figure` elements in cards, respecting aspect ratios and card corner rounding.
    *   Basic `astro:assets` AVIF/JPEG optimization.
-   **Photo Lightbox**: Basic PhotoSwipe prototype on About page.
-   **Styling & Theming**: Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, Light/Dark theme switching.
-   **Deployment**: Netlify deployment, functional build process.

## 3. Current Task: Blog Refinement - URL Structure, Listing Page Styling, and Image Handling (COMPLETE)
-   **Goal**: Fix blog URL extensions, style listing pages, ensure correct image display in cards, and update related pages (RSS, tags).
-   **Outcome**: Successfully implemented clean URLs, styled blog listing and tag pages with responsive DaisyUI cards, resolved image rendering issues, and fixed RSS/tag page functionality.

## 4. Planned Next Steps
-   **Site-wide Typographic Consistency**:
    *   Extend the use of semantic text utility classes to other pages and components (Homepage, About page, Contact page, Header, Footer, UI elements like buttons, form inputs).
-   Address remaining styling/layout issues from `hello-world.md` post review (if any beyond typography, e.g., spacing around blog post title/header).
-   **Blog Phase III: Future Considerations (Blog)** (Previously Blog Phase II & III)
    *   MDX for complex posts.
    *   OpenGraph tags & social sharing.
    *   Pagination.
    *   Comments system.
    *   Drafting and publishing actual blog content.

## 5. What's Left to Build / Improve (Other Areas - Post-Blog Focus)
(Content remains largely the same as previous version)
-   **Photo Galleries**: "Strangers Gallery" (date/location nav), thematic galleries, image hosting, OpenGraph.
-   **CV Page**: DaisyUI timeline, interactivity.
-   **Front Page**: Interactivity, landing page style.
-   **Footer**: Add links/info.
-   **Refactoring and Maintenance**: Utilize new Tailwind/DaisyUI features, testing strategy, devcontainer improvements, advanced font subsetting, general refactoring, Husky, ESLint, CI/CD, `justfile`.

## 6. Known Issues & Areas for Attention
-   Styling/layout issues identified in `hello-world.md` post (typography largely addressed, other spacing/layout might need review).
-   (Other existing known issues from previous version of this file remain relevant for future work beyond the blog).
